QAudioPlayer 0.3
============ ===

This is a replacement for the Tcl/Tk-based audio_player script included in the
Q-Audio distribution. It provides about the same functionality, but with some
extensions (FFT display, playback volume and speed control), bug fixes (this
version of the audio player correctly plays a file even if the file and output
device samplerates differ) and, last but not least, a much nicer, KDE/Qt-based
user interface.

You'll need KDE (probably a fairly recent version, 3.2 has been tested) for
running this program. To install, do the usual './configure && make && make
install'.

Usage should be fairly straightforward. Drag an audio file to the desktop icon
or invoke the qaudioplayer program with the filename as parameter to play the
file. (Note that only the file types recognized by libsndfile can be loaded.) 
You can also load a file in QAudioPlayer with the Open button. Use the Play
and Stop buttons to start and stop playback. Drag the big slider below the
wave display to move around in the file, or the little slider to the right of
the Stop button to change the playback volume. Switch between waveform and FFT
display and configure the FFT display using the controls at the top of the
window. With the Speed control you can adjust the playback speed, that's
probably the most important feature. ;-)

Requires Q 7.1/Q-Audio 2.4 or later.


Enjoy! :)
